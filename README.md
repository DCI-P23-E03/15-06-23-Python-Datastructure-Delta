# A quest game

- The hero of the game starts at initial point on the map (coordinates (0:0))
   +  Optional, a random map can be generated before the start of the game.
   + A poorman's option is just a tree (choose what to do at each step)
-  At each step your can either look for an item or try to answer a random question (python-related?) from a list. For correct answer you get an item.
- The goal is to collect a certain set of items that will be used to get access to a final challenge (a quiz or probably some mini-quest). There you either win or lose.
   + Optionally, creat a log of player's action in form of a story.
