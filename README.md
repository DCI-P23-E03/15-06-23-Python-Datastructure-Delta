# Travel Destination Recommendation System
### Data Types:
1. Lists: 
   - List of popular travel destinations
   - List of user preferences and ratings for different destinations

2. Dictionaries:
   - Dictionary mapping travel destinations to their respective features (e.g., attractions, climate, cost)
   - Dictionary mapping user preferences to their corresponding weights for different features

### Project Description:
The goal of the project is to create a travel destination recommendation system that suggests suitable travel destinations based on user preferences. The system will use a combination of lists and dictionaries to store and manipulate the necessary data.
